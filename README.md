JMSGames
========
Senior design project @ Lawrence Technological University. Course taken in 2012 for Electrical & Computer Engineering senior design.

OVERVIEW:
JMSGames is a senior design project for the electrical & computer engineering department at Lawrence Technological University in Southfield, MI. The course was taken in the 2011-2012 school year over two semesters.

The purpose of the project was to design a handheld gaming system, including both hardware and software components. Our group made a decision not to use any for of development kit for this project (i.e. Arduino, Raspberry Pi). Instead, our group used a bare processor manufactured by NXP, who provided driver software for us.

The final product included a game system with 4 general buttons (similar to Nintendo's A/B/X/Y buttons), 2 joysticks, 2 shoulder buttons, a start button, a full 24-bit color TFT, and a single speaker.

The demo software for the project includes a splash screen, a main menu with submenus (options, etc), a game demo of Pong (AI is minimal), and a testing mode, where each button press causes some event to occur (i.e. screen color changes, sound plays, etc).

GROUP:
Group consisted of 3 students. One electrical engineer, one computer engineer, one dual electrical & computer engineer.
